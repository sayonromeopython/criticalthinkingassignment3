Part 1:
Write a program that uses nested loops to collect data and calculate the average rainfall over a period of years. 
The outer loop will iterate once for each year. 
The inner loop will iterate twelve times, once for each month. Each iteration of the inner loop will ask the user for the inches of rainfall for that month. After all iterations, the program should display the number of months, the total inches of rainfall, and the average rainfall per month for the entire period.

rain_fall =0
number_of_years = 0
inches_of_rainfall = 0
number_of_months =0
total_inches_rainfall =0
average_rainfall 


nummber-of_months =0
total_inches_of-rainfall =0
number_of-years = int(input("Please enter the number of years")
#Outer loop
for year in rabge(1, number_of_years +1):
    for month in range(1, 13):
        rain_fall = input(F"Please input the inches for rainfall for each years{year}, Month{month}: ")
        if rain_fall.isdigit();
           total_inches-rainfall + =int(rain_fall)
           number_of_months +=1
         else:
              print("invalid input. Please input a valid input.")
# Average rainfall
average_rainfall =total_number_rainfall/number_months

print(F"\nNumber of months: {number_months}")
print(F"Total inches of rainfall: {Total_rainfall} inches")
print(F"Average rainfall per month: {average-rainfall} inches")
